# Linux .bashrc Notes

The **.bashrc** file is a shell script that automatically runs whenever you open a new interactive bash terminal session. It's your personal configuration file located in your home directory (`~/.bashrc`) that sets up your shell environment.

## Writing Variables in .bashrc

### Shell Variables (Local)

```bash
MY_VAR="value"
PATH_TO_PROJECT="/home/user/project"
```

These variables are **only available in the current shell** and won't be inherited by child processes.

### Environment Variables (Global)

```bash
export MY_VAR="value"
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
export DATABASE_URL="localhost:5432"
```

Variables defined with `export` become **environment variables** that are automatically passed to all child processes and subshells.

## Why Use Variables in .bashrc

- **PATH modifications**: Add custom directories to your command search path
- **Project settings**: Define project-specific environment variables
- **Aliases and shortcuts**: Create convenient command shortcuts
- **Tool configuration**: Set up development tools and their configurations


## Export vs Source

### Export Command

- **Purpose**: Makes variables available to child processes and subshells
- **Scope**: Variables flow **downward** from parent to child shells only
- **Usage**: `export VAR_NAME="value"`


### Source Command

- **Purpose**: Executes a script in the **current shell** (not a subshell)
- **Usage**: `source ~/.bashrc` or `. ~/.bashrc`
- **Effect**: Loads variables and functions into your current session without restarting the terminal


### Key Difference

When you run a script with `./script.sh`, exported variables disappear when the script ends because it runs in a subshell. When you use `source script.sh`, variables persist in your current shell.

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Edit .bashrc
echo 'export MY_APP_PATH="/usr/local/myapp"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Apply changes without restarting terminal
source ~/.bashrc

# Now MY_APP_PATH is available
echo $MY_APP_PATH
```
