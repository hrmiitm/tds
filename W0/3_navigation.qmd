## Overview

Linux file system hierarchy, path navigation, and basic file/folder operations.

## Everything is a File

In Linux, **everything is treated as a file**—even hardware devices!

| Type | Example | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Regular files | `script.py`, `data.txt` | Documents, code, images |
| Directories | `/home`, `/etc` | Folders containing files |
| Devices | `/dev/sda` | Hard drives, USB |
| Memory | `/dev/mem`, `/proc` | RAM, system info |

## Linux File Hierarchy

```text
/                     ← Root (top-level directory)
├── home/             ← User home directories
│   └── username/     ← Your personal files/folders (Documents, Downloads)
├── bin/              ← Essential binaries (ls, cp, mv)
├── mnt/              ← Mount point for external drives
├── dev/              ← Device files
├── etc/              ← Configuration files
├── tmp/              ← Temporary files
└── usr/              ← User programs and utilities
```

### Important Directories

| Directory | Purpose | Common Use |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| `/home/username` | Your personal space | Projects, dotfiles, configs |
| `/mnt` | Mount external drives | Windows drives in WSL → `/mnt/c/` |
| `/bin` | System binaries | Essential commands like `ls`, `cp` |

---

## Path Notation

### Special Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `/` | Root directory | `cd /` |
| `~` | Home directory | `cd ~` → `/home/username` |
| `.` | Current directory | `./script.sh` |
| `..` | Parent directory | `cd ..` |

---

## Navigation Commands

```bash
pwd     # Print present working directory
ls      # List files/folders (excludes hidden)
ls -a   # List all files/folders (includes hidden)
```

### `cd` - Change Directory

```bash
# Absolute path (starts from root /)
cd /home/username/projects

# Relative path (from current location)
cd projects       # current → projects folder
cd ./projects     # same as above
cd ../documents   # current → parent → documents folder
cd ../            # current → parent folder
cd ../../         # current → grandparent folder

# Shortcuts
cd ~              # Go to user home directory, /home/username
cd                # Same as cd ~
cd -              # Go to OLDPWD
```

---

## Hidden Files: `.xyz` vs `./xyz`

| Notation | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `cd .xyz` | `cd` to folder with name `.xyz` in current directory |
| `cd ./xyz` | `cd` to folder with name `xyz` in current directory |

```bash
ls -a          # Show hidden files
./script.sh    # Execute script in current folder
```

---

## Creating Files & Folders

### `touch` - Create Empty File

```bash
touch file.txt                      # Create single file
touch file1.txt file2.txt           # Create multiple files
touch ~/projects/newfile.py         # Create in specific path
```

### `mkdir` - Make Directory

```bash
mkdir myfolder                      # Create folder
mkdir -p projects/python/app        # Create nested folders
mkdir folder1 folder2               # Create multiple folders
```

---

## Removing Files & Folders

### `rm` - Remove Files

```bash
rm file.txt             # Remove file
rm -i file.txt          # Remove with confirmation
rm -f file.txt          # Force remove (no confirmation)
```

### `rmdir` - Remove Empty Directory

```bash
rmdir emptyfolder       # Remove empty folder only (fails if not empty)
```

### `rm -r` - Remove Directory Recursively

```bash
rm -r myfolder          # Remove folder and all contents
rm -rf myfolder         # Force remove without confirmation
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** `rm -rf` is dangerous! Double-check before using.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Navigation
pwd                     # Print current path
cd /path/to/dir         # Go to directory
cd ~                    # Go to home
cd ..                   # Go up one level
cd -                    # Go to previous directory

# Viewing
ls                      # List files
ls -la                  # List all with details

# Creating
touch file.txt          # Create file
mkdir folder            # Create folder
mkdir -p a/b/c          # Create nested folders

# Removing
rm file.txt             # Remove file
rmdir folder            # Remove empty folder
rm -r folder            # Remove folder with contents
```

### Path Symbols Summary

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `/` | Root directory |
| `~` | Home directory |
| `.` | Current directory |
| `..` | Parent directory |
| `-` | Previous directory (with `cd`) |
